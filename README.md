Deepfake Detection Project


Project Overview
This project focuses on the detection of **deepfake** media, which refers to AI-generated synthetic content, typically videos or images where a person’s face is manipulated. The project explores two main approaches for detecting deepfakes:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** To analyze visual patterns and facial anomalies.
2. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN):** To generate and discriminate between real and fake content, aiming to improve detection accuracy.

This project seeks to develop robust models capable of distinguishing real from fake media and contributes to the growing field of AI-based forensic tools.
